NOTES FOR ROBOT BASE #2

Use #8 1-3/4" screws for mounting wood blocks to channel.
Channel is 288mm (11-hole series 1120 channel).
Channel holes may need to be drilled out slightly.

Line up motor mount assembly so outermost corners of wood blocks
line up with edge of the deck but the motor mount assembly
remains completely within the deck circle.

Caster is mounted to deck with three screws.  The screw holes
are in a line parallel to front of base.  They are set back 1" from
front-facing edge of caster mount.  Middle screw is centered on
the caster mount.  There is 1" spacing between screws.


VENT HOLES

Used Actobotics channel to provide hole-drilling pattern.


ASYMMETRIC BATTERY BOX PLACEMENT

- Was originally intended to maintain balance with heavy SLA battery in one corner.
- Made more flat area available for through-holes for wiring.
  Screw post of box gets in the way if box is centered.


RC MOTOR CONTROL

L:  Yel <-> Blk, Blue <-> Red, CH1, [+|-] to red star conn. on rcvr, [S] has heat-shrink strain relief
R:  Yel <-> Red, Blue <-> Blk, CH2 [S|-], [+] is unused with heat-shrink for protection

Transmitter configured for "hybrid" control of channels 1 and 2.
Receiver blinks at power-up then goes solid when Transmitter is turned on.
Then ESCs should beep twice.


DISASSEMBLY STEPS

1.  Remove camera.
2.  Tip so all wheels are off ground and the robot rests on basket handles and tower edge.
3.  Disconnect motors from ESCs.
4.  Remove drive train assembly.
5.  Disconnect ESCs power.  Use screwdriver to pry apart connectors (gently).
6.  Remove tower by unscrewing all 4 round-head 3/4" wood screws.
7.  Remove basket.  It blocks battery box screws.
8.  Remove battery box.
9.  Remove caster by unscrewing top deck screws.
10. Take off tower mounting brackets.

Keep fasteners in small container with lid.
Reverse steps to reassemble.
