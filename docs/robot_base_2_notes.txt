Notes for Robot Base #2

Use #8 1-3/4" screws for mounting wood blocks to channel.
Channel is 288mm (11-hole series 1120 channel).
Channel holes may need to be drilled out slightly.

Line up motor mount assembly so outermost corners of wood blocks
line up with edge of the deck but the motor mount assembly
remains completely within the deck circle.

Caster is mounted to deck with three screws.  The screw holes
are in a line parallel to front of base.  They are set back 1" from
front-facing edge of caster mount.  Middle screw is centered on
the caster mount.  There is 1" spacing between screws.
