C++ Code for Robot Navigation Using Landmarks and OpenCV

The plan for this project was to make routines that could be used to calculate a robot's position in a room given two known landmark locations, a known camera height, and a known camera elevation (tilt).  On paper, it works fine and the test code returns the expected values.  But in reality, any uncertainty in the "known" camera settings can introduce huge errors.

So it's back to the old drawing board...
